Week 2's task is about performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. I worked on this dataset to practice understanding real-world data, finding patterns, and learning how different features affect the target variable (survival).

## Dataset Overview
The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers such as their age, gender, passenger class, fare, embarkation port, and whether they survived or not. It is a well-known dataset and is commonly used for learning data analysis and machine learning basics.

### Purpose of This Project
The main goal of this project was to:

* Get familiar with the structure of the dataset
* Identify missing values and data types
* Explore individual features using simple statistics and plots
* Analyze how different factors like gender, class, and age affected survival
* Build intuition before moving towards data preprocessing or modeling

Tools Used
I used Python for this project along with the following libraries:

* Pandas for data handling
* Matplotlib for basic visualizations
* Seaborn for better-looking plots

### What I did in the EDA
I started by loading the dataset and checking its shape, columns, and data types. After that, I looked at summary statistics to understand the distribution of numerical features. Missing values were analyzed to see which columns would need cleaning later.

Then I explored relationships between different features and survival using plots. 

### Key Observations
Some interesting things I noticed during the analysis:

* Female passengers had a much higher survival rate compared to males
* Passengers traveling in 1st class had better survival chances
* Children were more likely to survive than adults
* Passengers who paid higher fares generally had higher survival rates
* Age and Cabin had a lot of missing values

## Conclusion
This EDA helped me better understand the Titanic dataset and how to approach a data analysis problem step by step. It also made it clear why EDA is important before applying any machine learning models. Overall, this project was a good hands-on learning experience.
