# Mini Project: File Analyzer App

This is a simple File Analyzer app built using Python and Streamlit.
The main purpose of this project is to practice Python concepts we learnt in the past week like OOP, modules, file handling, and basic error handling, along with a simple UI.

---

## What does this app do?

After uploading a text file, the app displays:

* Total number of characters
* Total number of lines
* Total number of words

If a file other than `.txt` is uploaded, the app shows an error message.

## Concepts used in this project

This project focuses on the following Python concepts:

* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

  * A `FileAnalyzer` class is used to analyze file content
* **Modules**

  * The analyzer logic is separated from the Streamlit UI
* **File Handling**

  * Reading uploaded files and decoding text
* **Error Handling**

  * Handling unsupported files and decoding errors
